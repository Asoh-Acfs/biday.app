Dear Chinenye,

Wishing you a birthday as fabulous as your favorite color! 💅🏽💓  
You are annoying, irritating, a pain in my butt, and as extra as this app — and we LOVE that for you! 💄💝😒

May this year bring you all your heart's desires and more pink bags than Barbie.🎀 eyama 🤮🤢 

With all the love in the world,  
**Chidalu 💋**
